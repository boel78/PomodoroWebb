# PomodoroBuddy

## About
This is an application which will help with studying. I personally have used the pomodoro-technique for 7 years now. 
I think the technique helps you to keep focus on your tasks. 
The problem i have encountered with it, is to plan my sessions. 
If i have a session for studying that is 2 hours, then i have to sit down and do the math on how many pomodoros i can do in those 2 hours.
So i decided to make an App, the PomodoroBuddy. 
The plan is to introduce functionality to keep track of your weekly studies, provide you with achievements and rewards, and mainly.
Help you make your sessions as effectice and personal to you!
